The videos “reveal \nthe capabilities—and as a corollary, the vulnerabilities” of the security system.  Id. at 405. And \nsee AGO 15-06, relying on Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority , and applying the \nexemption to surveillance tapes from a security system for a public transit  authority building. \nCf. Gonzalez v.

State Attorney’s \nGOVERNMENT-IN-THE-SUNSHINE-MANUAL159\nOffice of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit v. Cable News Network, Inc. , 251 So. 3d 205 (Fla. 4th DCA \n2018).  As previously discussed on page 158, there are several exceptions to this confidentiality \nprovision, including a court order issued upon a showing of good cause.  In State Attorney’s \nOffice , the appellate court affirmed the trial judge’s order mandating release of surveillance video \nfrom a school shooting where 17 students and staff were killed.  The court found that the media \nhad established good cause because the footage revealed the conduct of public servants in the \ndischarge of their duties and also provided “insight” into the high school’s security “net” that \nfailed to protect the students and staff.  Id. at 215.\nBy contrast, the First District overturned the trial court’s determination that a news \norganization had shown good cause to obtain security footage from two correctional institutions.  \nFlorida Department of Corrections v. Miami Herald Media Company ,  278 So. 3d 786 (Fla. 1st \nDCA 2019).  At the hearing, the Miami Herald advised that it no longer needed the video \nrecordings as they were no longer newsworthy.  Nevertheless the court still found that the Herald \nhad satisfied the statutory exception to confidentiality, noting the awards the journalist received \nfor her reporting on prison issues, and that this fact, combined with the “extremely important \nright of freedom of the press” constituted good cause.  The appellate court reversed, finding that \nthe Herald “extinguished any claim to good cause when it unambiguously renounced its need for \nthe video footage.”  278 So. 3d at 790.\nc. Cybersecurity\nSection 119.01(2)(a), F .S., states that agencies “must provide reasonable public access to \nrecords electronically maintained and must ensure that exempt or confidential records are not \ndisclosed except as otherwise permitted by law.”   Cf. AGO 19-08 (pension board authorized to \nrelease nonpublic personnel information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with a vendor \nconducting cybersecurity testing of the board’s electronic data storage systems).\nAccordingly, an agency is not required to provide direct access to the agency’s electronic \nrecords through a hard drive provided by a requester, but must otherwise allow inspection and \ncopying of such records in a manner which will accommodate the request, but protect exempt \nor confidential materials from disclosure.

Op. to Hernandez, July 1, 2003 (agency not \nauthorized to purge or expunge documents it created while carrying out what it perceived to be \nits official duty based upon an accusation that the agency may have been mistaken in such an \nassessment).  Cf.  AGO 91-23 (clerk of court not authorized to expunge a court order from the \nOfficial Records, in the absence of a court order directing such action).\nc. Exempt records\nThe statutory restrictions on destruction of public records apply even if the record is exempt \nfrom disclosure.  For example, in AGO 81-12, the Attorney General’s Office concluded that \nthe City of Hollywood could not destroy or dispose of licensure, certification, or employment \nexamination question and answer sheets except as authorized by statute.   And see AGO 87-48 \n(statutory prohibition against placing anonymous materials in the personnel file of a school district \nemployee did not permit the destruction of such materials received in the course of official school \nbusiness, absent compliance with statutory restrictions on destruction of records).  An exemption \nonly removes the records from public access requirements, it does not exempt the records from the \nother provisions of Ch. 119, F .S., such as those requiring that public records be kept in a safe place \nor those regulating the destruction of public records.  AGO 93-86.  See s. 119.021, F .S.\nMoreover, if an assertion is made by the custodian that a requested record is not a public \nrecord subject to public inspection or copying, the requested record may not be disposed of for a \nperiod of 30 days after the date on which a written request to inspect or copy the record was made \nto the custodian; if a civil action is instituted within the 30-day period to enforce the provisions \n206\nGOVERNMENT-IN-THE-SUNSHINE-MANUAL\nof this section with respect to the requested record, the custodian may not dispose of the record \nexcept by order of a court of competent jurisdiction after notice to all affected parties.  Section \n119.07(1)(h), F .S\nd. Evidence obtained by law enforcement agencies\nDocumentary evidence obtained by a police department is a public record subject to \nretention schedules approved by the division.  AGO 04-51.  Accord Inf. Op. to Blair, August \n24, 2011 (evidence that constitutes a public record may be destroyed only in accordance with \nretention schedules established by the division and noting that the division has adopted a General \nRecords Schedule GS2 for law enforcement agencies).\nHowever, “the disposition of evidence not constituting a public record within the meaning \nof Chapter 119, Florida Statutes, would appear to be dependent upon an agency’s determination \nthat it is no longer needed.”  Inf.

For example:  \n• After a system restart, the old security features may have been reset to insecure \nsettings, and new features may not yet be activated. (For example, all old \npasswords may have reverted to the default system -password, even though new \npasswords are not yet a ssigned.) The same may happen at the time of a disaster \nrecovery.  \n• At the time of installation the switch may be vulnerable until the default security features have been replaced.  \nDHCP Server Insertion Attack  \nIt is often possible to change the configuration of a target phone by exploiting the DHCP response race when the IP phone boots. As soon as the IP phone requests a DHCP response, a rogue DHCP server can initiate a response with data fields containing false information.  \nThis attack allows for possible man in the middle attacks on the IP -media gateway, and IP \nPhones. Many methods exist with the potential to reboot the phone remotely, e.g., “social \nengineering”, ping flood, MAC spoofing (probably SNMP hooks, etc.).  REMEDIATION:  If possible, use static IP addresses for the IP Phones. This will remove \nthe necessity of using a DHCP server. Further, using a state based intrusion detection system can filter out DHCP server packets from IP Phone ports, allowing this traff ic only \nfrom the legitimate server.   \nTFTP Server Insertion Attack  \n \n12/27/2024   \nCJISSECPOL v6.0  G.2-6 It is possible to change the configuration of a target phone by exploiting the TFTP \nresponse race when the IP phone is resetting. A rogue TFTP server can supply spurious information before the legitimate server is able to respond to a request. This attack allows \nan attacker to change the configuration of an IP Phone.  \nREMEDIATION:  Using a state based intrusion detection system can filter out DHCP \nserver packets from IP Phone ports, allowing such traffic only from the legitimate server. Organizations looking to deploy VoIP systems should look for IP Phone instruments that \ncan download signed binary files.  \nAvailability and Denial of Service  \nAvailability refers to the notion that information and services be available for use when \nneeded. Availability is the most obvious risk for a switch. Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the switch software or protocols may lead to deterioration or even d enial of service or \nfunctionality of the switch. For example: if unauthorized access can be established to any branch of the communication channel (such as a CCS link or a TCP/IP link), it may be possible to flood the link with bogus messages causing sever e deterioration (possibly \ndenial) of service. A voice over IP system may have additional vulnerabilities with Internet connections. Because intrusion detection systems fail to intercept a significant percentage of Internet based attacks, attackers may be able to bring down VoIP systems by exploiting weaknesses in Internet protocols and services.  \nAny network may be vulnerable to denial of service attacks, simply by overloading the capacity of the system. With VoIP the problem may be especially severe, because of its sensitivity to packet loss or delay.  \nCPU Resource Consumption Attack without any account information.  \nAn attacker with remote terminal access to the server may be able to force a system \nrestart (shutdown all/restart all) by providing the maximum number of characters for the login and password buffers multiple times in succession. Additionally, IP Phones ma y \nreboot as a result of this attack.  \nIn addition to producing a system outage, the restart may not restore uncommitted changes or, in some cases, may restore default passwords, which would introduce intrusion vulnerabilities.  \nREMEDIATION:  The deployment of a firewall disallowing connections from \nunnecessary or unknown network entities is the first step to overcoming this problem. \nHowever, there is still the opportunity for an attacker to spoof his MAC and IP address, circumven ting the firewall protection.  \nDefault Password Vulnerability  \nIt is common for switches to have a default login/password set, e.g., admin/admin, or root  \n/root. Similarly, VoIP telephones often have default keypad sequences that can be used to \nunlock and modify network information.  \n \n12/27/2024   \nCJISSECPOL v6.0  G.2-7 This vulnerability would allow an attacker to control the topology of the network remotely, \nallowing for not only complete denial of service to the network, but also a port mirroring attack to the attacker’s location, giving the ability to intercept any ot her conversations \ntaking place over the same switch. Further, the switch may have a web server interface, providing an attacker with the ability to disrupt the network without advance knowledge \nof switch operations and commands.
