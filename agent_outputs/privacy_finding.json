Procedures annually and following any security incidents involving unauthorized access to CJI or systems used to process, store, or transmit CJI.  \nDiscussion: Planning policy and procedures for the controls in the PL family implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their \ndevelopment. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are \npreferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system -specific policies and \nprocedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be es tablished for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for \nsystems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Pro cedures can be \ndocumented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment  or audit  findings, security  incidents  or breaches,  or changes  in laws,  executive orders, \ndirectives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
