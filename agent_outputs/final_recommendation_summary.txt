Confidence: 85.00%
HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED: Project is on hold due to unresolved high risk or missing required controls. Recommend review by legal and public safety stakeholders.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Combined Risks
--------------------------------------------------
- ID: RISK-001
  Severity: High
  Description: The deployment of devices with 'Dual directional microphones' for 'Audio level monitoring' in a public space like Mizner Park could lead to the inadvertent or intentional capture of private conversations. This raises significant civil liberties concerns and potential violations of state and federal eavesdropping laws.
  Mitigation: Develop and legislate a strict, publicly accessible policy that prohibits the recording or analysis of conversational audio. Implement technical safeguards to ensure microphones only activate based on specific acoustic signatures (e.g., gunshots, car crashes) or decibel thresholds indicative of a public disturbance, and not human speech. Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance.

- ID: RISK-002
  Severity: High
  Description: The UbiHub platform is a network-connected device managed via a cloud system (UbiVu) with Over-the-Air (OTA) updates. This connectivity creates a significant attack surface for cybersecurity threats. A breach could compromise the video/audio feeds, expose stored data, or allow the device to be used as an entry point to attack wider municipal networks.
  Mitigation: Mandate a comprehensive, independent cybersecurity audit of the entire system (edge device, cloud platform, and data transmission) prior to deployment. Enforce strict access controls, including multi-factor authentication for all operators. Ensure the surveillance network is properly segmented from other municipal networks. Maintain a robust and timely patch management and incident response plan.

- ID: RISK-PRIV-001
  Severity: High
  Description: The deployment of dual 4K video cameras for continuous monitoring of public spaces like Mizner Park creates a risk of persistent surveillance. This can chill freedom of association and expression, and the high-resolution footage increases the likelihood of identifying individuals and tracking their movements without cause.
  Mitigation: Develop and publish a clear public policy defining the specific, limited purposes for video collection (e.g., traffic analysis, responding to active incidents). Implement privacy-by-design techniques such as real-time facial and license plate blurring by default, with de-blurring capabilities restricted to authorized personnel under specific, auditable conditions (e.g., a warrant or formal investigation request).

- ID: RISK-PRIV-002
  Severity: High
  Description: The use of 'dual directional microphones' creates a significant risk of capturing and recording private conversations in public spaces, which may violate wiretapping laws and reasonable expectations of privacy. While the stated purpose is 'audio level monitoring,' the hardware is capable of eavesdropping.
  Mitigation: Technically configure the sensors to only process and transmit decibel levels or specific pre-defined sound patterns (e.g., gunshots, breaking glass) without capturing, recording, or streaming any raw audio content. This limitation should be certified by the vendor and subject to independent audits. Publicly state that no conversations are being recorded.

- ID: RISK-PRIV-003
  Severity: High
  Description: The UbiHub platform has the capability to track individuals' movements by collecting unique device identifiers (MAC addresses) from smartphones via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals, even if users do not connect to the network. This can create detailed 'pattern of life' data without individuals' knowledge or consent.
  Mitigation: Disable the capability to collect MAC addresses or other unique identifiers from devices that are not actively connected to the public Wi-Fi network. For users who do connect, any collected identifiers must be immediately hashed or anonymized, and data should only be retained in an aggregated, non-identifiable format.

- ID: RISK-PRIV-004
  Severity: High
  Description: The vendor's product page states the platform has 'Open APIs for all data' and is 'designed for quick and simple sharing of data with third parties.' This creates a risk of broad, uncontrolled data sharing with other government agencies or private entities without sufficient oversight, transparency, or purpose limitation.
  Mitigation: Establish a strict data governance policy and data sharing agreement framework. Prohibit open API access to raw or personally identifiable data. All data sharing must be governed by a formal request process that is logged and audited, and a public transparency report should be issued detailing what categories of data are shared and with which entities.

- ID: RISK-OT-001
  Severity: High
  Description: The UbiHub device directly integrates with and controls streetlight operations (on/off, dimming). A remote or physical compromise of the device could allow an attacker to manipulate the lighting grid, potentially causing a targeted blackout in the Mizner Park area, which poses a significant public safety hazard.
  Mitigation: Implement strict network segmentation to isolate the lighting control OT network from other data networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi, video backhaul). Enforce strong authentication and role-based access control on the UbiVu cloud management platform. Regularly audit device configurations for unauthorized changes.

- ID: RISK-OT-002
  Severity: High
  Description: The UbiHub device provides public Wi-Fi access. If the public network is not properly isolated from the device's management or OT control plane, a malicious actor on the public Wi-Fi could pivot to attack the lighting control system or gain access to the device's core functions.
  Mitigation: Utilize VLANs and firewall rules to ensure complete network segregation between the public guest Wi-Fi network and the device's management and OT interfaces. The public network should be treated as an untrusted zone with no access to internal systems.

- ID: RISK-OT-004
  Severity: High
  Description: The system relies on a cloud-based platform (UbiVu) for management and uses 'Open APIs' for data access. A compromise of cloud credentials or a vulnerability in the API could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive video/audio data and allow an attacker to make malicious configuration changes to the entire fleet of devices, including the OT lighting controls.
  Mitigation: Enforce mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access to the UbiVu platform. Conduct regular third-party security assessments and penetration testing of the cloud platform and its APIs. Ensure all data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

- ID: RISK-OT-005
  Severity: High
  Description: Firmware updates are delivered Over-the-Air (OTA). An insecure OTA process could allow an attacker to push malicious firmware to the devices. This could create a persistent backdoor, exfiltrate data, or directly manipulate the integrated lighting control functions, leading to widespread operational disruption.
  Mitigation: Verify that the vendor's OTA update mechanism requires cryptographically signed firmware images to ensure their authenticity and integrity. All update communications must be conducted over an encrypted and mutually authenticated channel. Test new firmware in a non-production environment before deployment.

- ID: RISK-003
  Severity: Medium
  Description: The system features an 'AI processor for public safety and street analytics' to 'Detect unusual motion.' AI-powered analytics are susceptible to biases and inaccuracies, which could lead to false positives. This may result in law enforcement being dispatched for non-threatening situations or innocent individuals being wrongly targeted, eroding public trust and potentially leading to harmful confrontations.
  Mitigation: Establish a clear operational protocol that AI-generated alerts are for informational and situational awareness purposes only and must be verified by a human operator before any law enforcement or security personnel are dispatched. The system's AI performance should be periodically audited for accuracy and demographic bias.

- ID: RISK-004
  Severity: Medium
  Description: The product documentation mentions 'Open APIs for all data,' creating a risk of 'function creep' and unauthorized data sharing. Data initially collected for public safety could be shared with or accessed by third parties for unintended purposes, such as commercial marketing, immigration enforcement, or monitoring of protected activities, without public knowledge or oversight.
  Mitigation: Create a robust data governance framework that explicitly defines the purpose of data collection, specifies data retention periods, and outlines a strict protocol for data access and sharing. Prohibit the sale or transfer of data to third-party data brokers. All API access must be logged, audited, and restricted to authorized entities under strict, publicly-disclosed data-sharing agreements.

- ID: RISK-PRIV-005
  Severity: Medium
  Description: The collection of multiple data types (video analytics, device identifiers, crowd density) on a single platform allows for the potential fusion of these datasets to de-anonymize individuals and create detailed personal profiles. For example, correlating a person's visual presence with their unique device identifier.
  Mitigation: Implement technical and policy-based controls to prevent the correlation of different data streams on an individual level. Data should be segregated by purpose, with strict access controls limiting the ability to query across datasets. Employ data minimization by only collecting the data necessary for each specific, approved use case.

- ID: RISK-PRIV-006
  Severity: Medium
  Description: The 'hybrid' storage model (on-device and cloud) increases the attack surface for a data breach. The product page specifies '15 days video storage' on the device, but lacks a clear retention policy for data stored in the cloud, creating a risk of indefinite storage of sensitive information.
  Mitigation: Establish and enforce a comprehensive data retention policy for all data, both at the edge and in the cloud, ensuring data is automatically and permanently deleted after its specified purpose is fulfilled. Conduct regular, independent security audits and penetration tests of the entire system. Enforce strong access controls and encryption for all data at rest and in transit.

- ID: RISK-OT-003
  Severity: Medium
  Description: The devices are physically installed on streetlights in a public area, making them susceptible to tampering. An attacker could connect to the device's PoE port, intended for third-party sensors, to gain unauthorized access to the local network, or attempt to disrupt power to the unit, affecting both surveillance and lighting.
  Mitigation: Physically harden the devices using tamper-resistant enclosures. Implement port security on all physical interfaces, disabling any unused ports (including PoE) in the device configuration. Configure tamper alerts to be sent to the central management system if a device goes offline unexpectedly.
