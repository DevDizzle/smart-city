1. Deployment Recommendation
--------------------------------------------------
Decision: MITIGATE
Context: Engineering Lab Parking

Proposed Solutions:
  * UbiCell-ST-NEMA @ Mounted on all 30ft streetlight poles throughout the Engineering Lab Parking surface lot.
    Value: Directly achieves 40% energy savings through intelligent dimming and reduces the campus carbon footprint.
  * UbiHub-AP-AI @ Installed on select poles with fiber access near primary pedestrian entrances and high-traffic walkways.
    Value: Delivers high-speed outdoor WiFi and enhanced safety monitoring while reducing visual clutter on poles.
  * UbiHub-AP6 @ Mounted on existing 30ft poles throughout the Engineering Lab Parking surface lot.
    Value: Delivers high-capacity outdoor WiFi 6 to bridge the digital divide, ensuring students have seamless access to academic resources while commuting between buildings.
  * UbiHub-AI+ @ Installed on 30ft poles located at the perimeter and high-traffic pedestrian entrances of the parking lot.
    Value: A multi-functional solution that enhances student safety through intelligent monitoring while providing premium connectivity and reducing energy waste.

2. Risk Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
- [Medium] RISK-001: Risk of physical injury to pedestrians during the installation of hardware on 30ft poles in a high-traffic area during class changes.
  Mitigation: Schedule all installation activities during low-traffic periods, such as late nights or weekends, and establish secure physical perimeters around poles during work.
- [High] RISK-002: Potential for total lighting failure in the parking lot if the UbiCell-ST-NEMA smart controllers experience a network or system-wide software failure, leading to unsafe conditions at night.
  Mitigation: Configure the hardware with a 'fail-safe' mode that ensures streetlights default to 100% brightness if communication with the central management system is lost.
- [Medium] RISK-003: Privacy and security risks associated with the deployment of AI-enabled hubs (UbiHub-AI+) in a high-traffic student area, potentially leading to unauthorized surveillance or data breaches.
  Mitigation: Implement strict data encryption, edge-processing to minimize data transmission, and establish a transparent data governance policy that is shared with the campus community.
- [Low] RISK-004: Structural integrity risk from mounting multiple devices (UbiHub and UbiCell) on existing 30ft poles, which may not have been originally rated for the increased wind load or weight.
  Mitigation: Conduct a structural engineering assessment on a representative sample of existing poles to ensure they can safely support the additional hardware weight and wind resistance.
- [High] RISK-PRIV-001: The use of UbiHub-AP-AI and UbiHub-AI+ devices, which feature integrated cameras and AI processing, may lead to the collection and processing of identifiable facial images or physical characteristics of students and staff in high-traffic walkways.
  Mitigation: Implement edge-based processing to ensure no raw video or identifiable images are stored; apply automated blurring of faces; and establish a strict data retention policy for any captured footage.
- [Medium] RISK-PRIV-002: AI-enabled hardware mounted at perimeter and high-traffic entrances may be used for License Plate Recognition (LPR), creating a record of individual movement and parking habits associated with specific vehicles.
  Mitigation: Anonymize or hash license plate data immediately after collection; restrict access to LPR data to authorized security personnel only; and provide clear signage regarding vehicle surveillance.
- [Medium] RISK-PRIV-003: The UbiHub-AP6 access points may collect MAC addresses or other device identifiers from students' mobile devices, enabling the tracking of individual movement patterns throughout the Engineering Lab Parking lot.
  Mitigation: Implement MAC address randomization or hashing at the point of ingestion; ensure Wi-Fi data is used only for aggregate traffic analysis rather than individual tracking.
- [Medium] RISK-PRIV-004: Lack of transparency regarding the multi-functional nature of the streetlight-mounted hardware (Safety vs. Connectivity vs. AI Surveillance) may result in individuals being monitored without informed consent or awareness.
  Mitigation: Deploy prominent signage at all pedestrian and vehicle entrances to the parking lot informing individuals of the types of data collected and providing a link to a detailed privacy policy.
- [High] RISK-OT-001: Potential for lateral movement from public-facing IoT infrastructure to sensitive Engineering Lab OT networks. If the UbiHub devices share physical or logical network paths with lab control systems, a compromise of a pole-mounted device could grant access to critical lab assets.
  Mitigation: Implement strict network segmentation using firewalls and VLANs to ensure the parking lot's 'Connectivity' network is completely isolated from the Engineering Lab's internal OT/ICS environment.
- [Medium] RISK-OT-002: Physical security vulnerability of network backhaul. Devices are mounted on 30ft poles, but fiber access points and wiring at the base of the poles in a high-traffic student area may be susceptible to tampering or unauthorized physical tapping.
  Mitigation: Secure all pole base plates with tamper-resistant locks and implement MAC-based port security or 802.1X authentication on all fiber and ethernet drops to prevent unauthorized device connection.
- [Medium] RISK-OT-003: Unauthorized surveillance and data leakage via compromised Edge AI hardware. The UbiHub-AP-AI and AI+ units contain computer vision capabilities; if compromised, these could be used to monitor sensitive activities, personnel movements, or equipment deliveries at the Engineering Lab.
  Mitigation: Ensure all edge devices use encrypted firmware signing, disable unnecessary services/ports, and implement centralized logging to detect anomalous data patterns or unauthorized access to camera feeds.
- [Low] RISK-OT-004: RF Interference with existing OT wireless systems. High-density Wi-Fi 6 (UbiHub-AP6) deployment in a parking lot adjacent to an engineering lab may cause signal noise or interference with specialized wireless sensors or industrial wireless protocols used within the lab.
  Mitigation: Perform a comprehensive RF site survey before and after installation to ensure channel overlapping does not disrupt existing lab-based OT wireless communications.
