Given the\n\u00a0\noverlapping relationship of cybersecurity and privacy, much of the information in\n\u00a0\nthis use case may sound similar to, or even identical to, aspects of cybersecurity risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement.  This reinforces the notion that cybersecurity and privacy are closely\n\u00a0\nrelated and should generally be considered in tandem.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne fundamental tenet of Smart Cities is the creation, collection, use, and other\n\u00a0\nmethods of processing often vast amounts of data to improve city services and\n\u00a0\noperations.  This has the potential to introduce significant data privacy risks.\n\u00a0\nWhether we are discussing individual privacy, corporate privacy, or municipal\n\u00a0\nprivacy, compromised data can result in tangible and irreparable damage.  For\n\u00a0\nexample, individuals can lose their reputation, job, family, health coverage, bank\n\u00a0\naccounts, or control of their identity; a company can lose its intellectual property,\n\u00a0\nreputation, customer base, etc.; and a municipality can lose control of its\n\u00a0\ninfrastructure and supported services, whereby thousands or millions of people can\n\u00a0\nbe affected.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe RMF provides a process for establishing a Privacy Program to help organizations\n\u00a0\nprotect data over its entire lifecycle.

This use case posits\n\u00a0\nsome of the major activities, key stakeholders, and potential resources for each step\n\u00a0\nof the cybersecurity and privacy risk management process.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA key element of Smart Cities is smart public safety.  Smart public safety starts with\n\u00a0\ntraditional public safety agencies - namely fire, law enforcement, emergency\n\u00a0\nmedical services, and 911 call centers - that would like to add IoT devices as another\n\u00a0\nmeans of communication between first responders and between the first\n\u00a0\nresponders and the 911 dispatch centers.  Public safety agencies are already starting\n\u00a0\nto use body-worn devices (e.g., cameras and biometric sensors).  During the incident\n\u00a0\noperations, IoT data from sensors and other real-time devices can increase\n\u00a0\nsituational awareness and aid in incident command and control.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 0: Prepare\n\u00a0\nIn smart public safety, public safety agencies themselves could be responsible for\n\u00a0\ncybersecurity and privacy; alternatively, they could be partnering with IT or\n\u00a0\ninformation security organizations (e.g., Department of Information Technology).  In\n\u00a0\nmost states in the U.S., the state legislature authorizes and appropriates funds based\n\u00a0\non an authorized scope.  The IT organization will often have a cybersecurity and\n\u00a0\nprivacy strategy that includes using one or more of the risk management\n\u00a0\nframeworks, or elements thereof.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor this use case we are assuming that we are using the NIST RMF, which has been\n\u00a0\ndetailed in this Guidebook.  There are also existing statewide security policies; but\n\u00a0\nthey do not allow connected IoT devices until risk management security capabilities\n\u00a0\nhave been defined, and devices provide the necessary capabilities to support the\n\u00a0\nrequisite cybersecurity and privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is the intention of this support for implementation of IoT cybersecurity and privacy\n\u00a0\nto be funded by further State legislature appropriating funds for extending the risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement program for Smart Cities and smart public safety which includes\n\u00a0\nusage of body worn devices and supporting vendor upgrades.\n\u00a0\n48 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 1: Categorize\n\u00a0\nThe information types collected, processed, and transmitted by the wearable IoT\n\u00a0\ndevices are real-time video and sensor data.  The systems and system components\n\u00a0\nare categorized as critical information data, and that mandates that the systems and\n\u00a0\nnetworks be of a public safety grade mission critical mode of operation.  Public\n\u00a0\nSafety Grade cybersecurity and privacy policies and standards have been described\n\u00a0\nfor normal mobile devices, but corresponding policies and standards for IoT-based\n\u00a0\ndevices still need to be defined.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 2: Select\n\u00a0\nNIST RMF-based cybersecurity and privacy controls have been selected for IT\n\u00a0\nsystems security controls.  Additional cybersecurity and privacy controls for IoT\n\u00a0\nwould follow the NISTIR 8196\n and NISTIR 8228\n and the new, example (12) security\n\u00a0\n38\n39\ncontrols and (4) privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo additional controls beyond those proposed in NISTIR 8196 and NISTIR 8228 have\n\u00a0\nbeen identified.  No tailoring of controls has been done as the IT Department wants\n\u00a0\nto identify and implement a standardized and consistent (i.e., baseline) set of\n\u00a0\nsecurity control. This may change as the implementation of IoT devices is better\n\u00a0\ndefined.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 3: Implement\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity and privacy requirements from NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, NIST SP 800-39,\n\u00a0\nNIST S",

While this\n\u00a0\nGuidebook is largely based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s\n\u00a0\n(NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF), the Guidebook is not intended to\n\u00a0\nobviate any existing cybersecurity and privacy risk management practices, policies,\n\u00a0\nor processes.  Rather, it is intended to supplement existing practices, policies, and\n\u00a0\nprocesses and provide some Smart City-specific cybersecurity and risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement considerations.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf your organization already uses the NIST RMF or another broadly-adopted risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement framework or standard, such as the ISO/IEC 27000 Information\n\u00a0\nSecurity Management Systems (ISMS) standards, then this Guidebook can provide\n\u00a0\nsome additional critical Smart City-specific cybersecurity and privacy\n\u00a0\nconsiderations to understand and possibly incorporate into your existing\n\u00a0\napproach.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf your organization uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) as a means to\n\u00a0\ndescribe and guide cybersecurity activities, this Guidebook can provide additional\n\u00a0\nand more robust cybersecurity and privacy management processes to consider\n\u00a0\n(some aspects of which you may already be doing) and potentially implement to\n\u00a0\nsupplement existing practices.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLastly, if your organization does not have a systematic approach to Smart City\n\u00a0\ncybersecurity and privacy, this Guidebook provides a high-level overview of a\n\u00a0\nrisk-based approach to managing Smart City cybersecurity and privacy.

Executive Summary\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBackground\n\u00a0\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched the Global City\n\u00a0\nTeams Challenge (GCTC) program in 2014 as a means to encourage collaboration\n\u00a0\nacross the global Smart Cities community.  The goal of GCTC is to \u201cestablish and\n\u00a0\ndemonstrate replicable, scalable, and sustainable models for incubation and\n\u00a0\ndeployment of interoperable, standards-based solutions using advanced\n\u00a0\ntechnologies such as IoT and CPS, and demonstrate their measurable benefits in\n\u00a0\ncommunities and cities.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\nIn 2018, NIST and the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology\n\u00a0\nDirectorate (DHS S&T) partnered to initiate the Smart and Secure Cities and\n\u00a0\nCommunities Challenge (SC3) as an effort to build on the GCTC program and\n\u00a0\ndemonstrate the \u201cvalue and return on investment for designed-in trustworthiness\n\u00a0\nfor smart city deployments.\u201d\n\u00a0\n2\n\u00a0\nIn support of the SC3 effort, the Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee\n\u00a0\n(CPAC) was established as a public working group comprised of cybersecurity and\n\u00a0\nprivacy professionals and practitioners across the GCTC community.  The CPAC has\n\u00a0\nrepresentation from all levels of government, non-profit organizations, academia,\n\u00a0\nand the private sector.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe CPAC public working group is intended to provide a forum for members to\n\u00a0\nshare their expertise, leverage industry best practices, and further collaborate with\n\u00a0\nrelevant organizations.  The CPAC also serves as a cybersecurity and privacy resource\n\u00a0\nfor the GCTC-SC3 SuperClusters and Action Clusters.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis Guidebook has been developed by the CPAC with the primary goal of providing\n\u00a0\na source document for all entities interested in learning how to manage upcoming\n\u00a0\nSmart City cybersecurity and privacy challenges and risks.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPurpose\n\u00a0\nAdvances in information and communication technologies (ICT) and the advent of\n\u00a0\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices are enabling municipalities\u2019 development and\n\u00a0\ndeployment of Smart City capabilities and solutions.

Smart Cities: Benefits and Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCities and communities stand to harvest unprecedented benefits from advances in\n\u00a0\ninformation and communications technologies (ICT), in general, and Internet of\n\u00a0\nThings (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular.  Smart cities inevitably\n\u00a0\nintroduce new or heighten existing cyber risks, which demand proper consideration\n\u00a0\nin design to ensure the optimal realization of intended Smart City outcomes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSmart Cities Benefits\n\u00a0\nSmart cities are associated solutions and capabilities defined by the integration of\n\u00a0\ntechnology, connectivity, and data to improve the quality of and accessibility to\n\u00a0\ncitizen services and to improve the livability of the city and community.  Smart cities\n\u00a0\nhave the potential to address key challenges, including air and other environmental\n\u00a0\npollution, traffic congestion, crime, and economic development.  Many of these\n\u00a0\nchallenges can be directly connected to a direct and/or an indirect fiscal impact (e.g.,\n\u00a0\noperational costs, lost economic productivity); conversely, Smart City solutions may\n\u00a0\nhave direct benefits in terms of improved services or livability as well as associated\n\u00a0\nbenefits of cost savings through enhanced efficiency and a boost in economic\n\u00a0\nproductivity, development, and opportunity.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3\nWhile there are many benefits associated with the promise of Smart Cities, there are\n\u00a0\nalso many risks and opportunities for unintended consequences.  For Smart Cities to\n\u00a0\ntruly be successful and reach their full potential, it is important for those designing,\n\u00a0\ndeveloping, and implementing Smart City solutions to properly manage risk.  Risk, in\n\u00a0\nthe context of Smart Cities, may be found in many common categories such as\n\u00a0\n3\n National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence research on mitigating IoT-based DDoS as presented by\n\u00a0\nTim Polk, Russ Gyurek, and Joshua Lawton at CPAC Cybersecurity Symposium for Smart Cities in San\n\u00a0\nJose, California, on October 3, 2018.\n\u00a0\n10 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\noperational, financial, technical, contractual, legal, reputational, and political risk;\n\u00a0\nhowever, one area of risk that is becoming increasingly important is cybersecurity\n\u00a0\nand privacy risk.  Addressing cybersecurity and privacy by design is critical to risk\n\u00a0\nmitigation and enabling the successful development of Smart Cities and its benefits\n\u00a0\nto citizens.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity and Privacy Risk\n\u00a0\nRisk (R) is commonly considered a function of three factors: vulnerability (V), threat\n\u00a0\n(T), and consequence (C).  While there is some contention on what the appropriate\n\u00a0\nformula is, there is a clear, positive relationship between risk and each of its three\n\u00a0\nvariables (e.g., as consequence increases, risk increases).  A common mathematical\n\u00a0\nexpression of risk is that risk is the product of vulnerability, threat, and consequence\n\u00a0\n\u2013 or R = V x T x C.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis general notion of risk certainly applies in the cybersecurity and privacy context.\n\u00a0\nWith the increasing ubiquity of connectivity, cybersecurity and privacy risk is a\n\u00a0\nconcept that must be thoroughly considered in most, if not all, domains, including\n\u00a0\nthe Smart City environment.  Risk in the Smart City context can be attributed to a\n\u00a0\nwide variety of factors given the nearly infinite permutations of potential Smart\n\u00a0\nCity-related vulnerabilities, threats, and consequences.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExample Smart City Cybersecurity and Privacy Vulnerabilities, Threats, and\n\u00a0\nConsequences\n\u00a0\nVulnerabilities\n\u00a0\nThreats\n\u00a0\nConsequences\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nLack of awareness of all\n\u00a0\nauthorized and\n\u00a0\nunauthorized devices/assets\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nPoorly-implemented\n\u00a0\nencryption or lack of\n\u00a0\nencryption\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nInability to patch or update\n\u00a0\nsoftware/firmware\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nUse of default administrator\n\u00a0\npasswords\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nSusceptibility to distributed\n\u00a0\ndenial of service (DDoS)\n\u00a0\nattacks\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nLack of security assessment\n\u00a0\nand software code testing\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nInadequate security and\n\u00a0\nprivacy awareness and\n\u00a0\ntraining\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nWeak or immature supply\n\u00a0\nchain risk management\n\u00a0\npractices\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nNational-state and\n\u00a0\nstate-sponsored actors\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nOrganized crime and other\n\u00a0\ncriminal groups\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nTerrorist groups\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nHacktivists\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nInsiders/employees \u2013\n\u00a0\nwhether malicious,\n\u00a0\nunintentional, or negligent\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nExternal suppliers, service\n\u00a0\nproviders, vendors, and\n\u00a0\npartners (e.g., supply chain\n\u00a0\nrisk, interdependence and\n\u00a0\nintegration risk)\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nOther individual hackers or\n\u00a0\nhacking groups\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nNatural and man-made\n\u00a0\ndisasters\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nDisruption of government\n\u00a0\nservices to citizens\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nLoss or leakage of citizen\n\u00a0\npersonally identifiable\n\u00a0\ninformation (PII)\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nFinancial loss or expense\n\u00a0\n(e.g., lawsuits, regulatory\n\u00a0\npenalties, theft of funds, cost\n\u00a0\nof response and remediation)\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nFacilitation of terrorist event\n\u00a0\n\u2013 whether physical, digital, or\n\u00a0\ncombined\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nDegradation of trust in\n\u00a0\ngovernment and\n\u00a0\ngovernment services\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nDanger to public health or\n\u00a0\nsafety\n\u00a0\n11 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nMany of the vulnerabilities and threats that could affect Smart City environments are\n\u00a0\nsimilar to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats commonly found in the\n\u00a0\ntraditional enterprise information technology (IT) environment.  Additionally, it is\n\u00a0\nunarguable that the consequences in the Smart City context are potentially more\n\u00a0\ncomplex and catastrophic given the cyber-physical aspects of Smart Cities as well as\n\u00a0\nthe broad reach and expansiveness of Smart City implementations (e.g., citizens,\n\u00a0\ngovernment, the private sector, cross-jurisdictional elements).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMoreover, it is important to recognize that cybersecurity and privacy risks to Smart\n\u00a0\nCity environments is not merely hypothetical or notional.  Indeed, there have been\n\u00a0\nseveral high-profile cybersecurity and privacy events (among countless data\n\u00a0\nbreaches and attacks around the globe) that have had real, damaging effects on\n\u00a0\nsome cities and communities who are leading the Smart City movement.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe following four tangible examples of Smart City cybersecurity and privacy risk are\n\u00a0\nbased on publicly-available information.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAtlanta Ransomware (March 2018)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4\nIn March 2018, the City of Atlanta, Georgia, fell victim to a SamSam ransomware\n\u00a0\nattack.

In turn, earned trust can help expedite\n\u00a0\nthe development and deployment of Smart City capabilities.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIndeed, the failure to proactively manage cybersecurity and privacy risks can be a\n\u00a0\ndetriment to Smart City efforts and can negatively impact the very systems intended\n\u00a0\nto improve city services and citizens\u2019 livelihoods.  In the example of SingHealth, a\n\u00a0\ndata breach and data exposure was the catalyst for Singapore to temporarily\n\u00a0\nsuspend its Smart Nation activities and conduct a holistic review of its cybersecurity\n\u00a0\nand privacy practices.  SingHealth suffered deep monetary fines.  It is certainly\n\u00a0\nplausible to see how data breaches or leakages could erode public support for Smart\n\u00a0\nCity implementations that require the collection, processing, and storage of citizen-\n\u00a0\nor community-related data.  Proactively managing cybersecurity and privacy risks\n\u00a0\ncan prove to be more effective and cost-efficient, especially when considering the\n\u00a0\ntotal cost of ownership and including potential costs of breach response and\n\u00a0\nremediation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUltimately, municipalities should continue to focus on the primary mission of\n\u00a0\nimproving the livability of their communities; however, cybersecurity and privacy risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement should be viewed as essential supporting functions.  Smart city\n\u00a0\nsolutions should be developed and deployed in a risk-aware manner, and\n\u00a0\ncybersecurity and privacy should be included as areas of risk (alongside others, such\n\u00a0\nas fiscal, environmental, legal, or contractual).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe following chapter and the supporting appendices focus on describing the key\n\u00a0\nelements of a cybersecurity and privacy risk management process or program.\n\u00a0\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to cybersecurity and privacy risk management.\n\u00a0\nMunicipalities and Smart City stakeholders will need to determine what risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement processes and functions fit their needs the best, with the\n\u00a0\nunderstanding that the approach to risk management will necessarily adapt and\n\u00a0\nmature over time as requirements and risks change.\n \n \n16 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nChapter 3.  Trustworthy Smart Cities through Risk Management\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOrganizations participating in the Smart City environment \u2013 whether as\n\u00a0\nmunicipalities, critical infrastructure operators, product or service providers, or\n\u00a0\ncitizens \u2013 already consider at least some aspects of risk (e.g., business risk,\n\u00a0\nreputational risk) in the development and deployment of Smart City capabilities and\n\u00a0\nsolutions.  And one growing area of risk is cybersecurity and privacy risk.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMany of the cybersecurity- and privacy-related vulnerabilities and threats that could\n\u00a0\naffect Smart City environments are similar to those commonly found in the\n\u00a0\ntraditional enterprise IT environment.  The cyber-physical aspects of Smart Cities as\n\u00a0\nwell as the interconnections and interdependencies that are characteristic of Smart\n\u00a0\nCity solutions could potentially result in more complex and catastrophic\n\u00a0\nconsequences (e.g., disruption of government services to citizens; terrorist event;\n\u00a0\ndanger to public health or safety).  The recognition of these vulnerabilities, threats,\n\u00a0\nand consequences necessitates the consideration and adoption of risk management\n\u00a0\nprocesses and practices that can help Smart City organizations make risk-based\n\u00a0\nbusiness decisions, such as identifying what levels of risk are acceptable and where\n\u00a0\ninvestments need to be made to mitigate risk.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity and privacy risk management does not have to be an undue burden.\n\u00a0\nIn fact, there are a variety of tools that can make it easier to integrate risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement; and risk management, in turn, will be an enabler for Smart City\n\u00a0\nsolutions and capabilities.\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nThere is an abundance of existing guidelines, standards, and references to\n\u00a0\ninform and improve risk management processes\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nRisk management can be a tool and enabler for Smart City solutions by\n\u00a0\nestablishing and increasing trust in government and trust in systems\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nLeveraging existing relationships (e.g., inter-/intra-governmental, public-private\n\u00a0\npartnerships, new and existing suppliers) to collaborate on risk management\n\u00a0\nobjectives can increase effectiveness and efficiency in a limited-resource\n\u00a0\nenvironment\n\u00a0\nWhile the need for cybersecurity and privacy risk management is clear, a successful\n\u00a0\nrisk management program will require coordination and commitment from all levels\n\u00a0\nof government and from all Smart City participants.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOrganizations will need to adopt processes and practices that are appropriate for\n\u00a0\ntheir specific needs.  The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) is one tool, of\n\u00a0\nmany, that can help organizations supplement and refine existing risk management\n\u00a0\npractices or establish new risk management processes.  At the most generic level,\n\u00a0\nthe RMF consists of seven iterative steps - an initial preparatory step to ensure\n\u00a0\nreadiness to execute the process followed by the six main steps - that can be more\n\u00a0\nstrategic or tactical as needed.\n\u00a0\n17 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.\nPrepare\u200b\n for risk management at all organizational levels\n\u00a0\n1.\nCategorize\u200b\n information and information systems\n\u00a0\n2.\nSelect\u200b\n and tailor security and privacy controls\n\u00a0\n3.\nImplement\u200b\n security and privacy controls\n\u00a0\n4.\nAssess\u200b\n (independently) security and privacy controls for proper and intended\n\u00a0\nimplementation, operation, and risk outcomes\n\u00a0\n5.\nAuthorize\u200b\n system operation\n\u00a0\n6.\nMonitor\u200b\n (continuously) to adjust to system and environment changes and to\n\u00a0\nmaintain awareness of organization risk posture\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperationalizing, standardizing and coordinating risk management across an\n\u00a0\norganization is critical for minimizing cybersecurity and privacy risks during the\n\u00a0\ndevelopment and operation of Smart City solutions.  Cities \u2013 and all other\n\u00a0\nparticipants in the Smart City environment \u2013 must determine the appropriate\n\u00a0\npolicies and processes to adopt and implement based on their current risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement practices, risk posture, and their risk management strategy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is Cybersecurity and Privacy Risk Management?\n\u00a0\nRisk management is a critical practice that not only assists in mitigating potential\n\u00a0\ncatastrophic consequences but also enables the success of Smart City systems,\n\u00a0\nprojects, and programs by enhancing trust.  The risk management process\n\u00a0\nultimately helps organizations make risk-based business decisions, such as\n\u00a0\nidentifying what levels of risk are acceptable to the organization and where\n\u00a0\ninvestment needs to be made to mitigate risk, namely by reducing vulnerabilities\n\u00a0\n(e.g., implementing security or privacy controls) or limiting consequences (e.g.,\n\u00a0\ndeveloping continuity of operations capabilities, purchasing cyber insurance to\n\u00a0\nminimize financial loss).\n  That said, risk management is more substantial than\n\u00a0\n8\nsimply implementing more cybersecurity and privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n8\n Organizations can make decisions and investments to reduce vulnerabilities and consequences.  The\n\u00a0\nthird component of risk \u2013 threat \u2013 is external to the organization and typically cannot be directly\n\u00a0\ncontrolled.  However, organizations need to understand their sector, industry, or regional threat\n\u00a0\nenvironment to inform their risk management processes and decisions.\n\u00a0\n18 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nNIST\u2019s Approach to Organization-Wide Risk Management\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9\n\u00a0\nRisk management can be viewed as a process and practice that requires\n\u00a0\nparticipation from, and engagement of, all levels of a given organization.  The risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement functions at each level are interconnected and inform the risk\n\u00a0\ndecisions made at the other levels.  The National Institute of Standards and\n\u00a0\nTechnology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF) proposes a three-level\n\u00a0\napproach to risk management: (1) organization level; (2) mission/business process\n\u00a0\nlevel; and (3) information system or system component level.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt the top of the pyramid, the organization establishes the risk management\n\u00a0\nstrategy, communicates risk management guidance, identifies missions and\n\u00a0\nbusiness processes, and provides oversight of the organization\u2019s risk posture.  The\n\u00a0\nrisk guidance developed at the strategic levels determines the risk management\n\u00a0\nactivities performed at the lower, tactical levels \u2013 e.g., the information system and\n\u00a0\nsystem component level.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe security and privacy risk management practices ultimately implemented at the\n\u00a0\ninformation system level directly reflect the risk management principles defined by\n\u00a0\nthe organization.  Reporting of system risk posture up to the organization level is\n\u00a0\nintended to provide an aggregate view of risk across the organization, allowing the\n\u00a0\norganization to adjust and achieve the desired risk posture.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the Smart City context, the organization level may include entities such as the\n\u00a0\nmayor\u2019s office and key risk-related offices such as those of the chief risk officer, chief\n\u00a0\ninformation officer, chief information security officer, or chief privacy officer.\n\u00a0\n9\n NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, \u200b\nRisk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations\u200b\n,\n\u00a0\nDecember 2018.\n\u00a0\n19 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nUnderneath this level may be a transportation mission area or an acquisition\n\u00a0\nmanagement business process area.  These areas would naturally involve a wider\n\u00a0\narray of stakeholders; for example, the transportation mission area may include a\n\u00a0\nwide variety of transportation-related agencies, including the departments of\n\u00a0\ntransportation and public works as well as emergency management and law\n\u00a0\nenforcement entities.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt the most tactical level \u2013 the information system level \u2013 the risk management\n\u00a0\nprocess may focus on a single system, solution, or capability.  Example systems of\n\u00a0\ninterest could be defined as a smart parking meter system or a system comprised of\n\u00a0\ntraffic sensors and the back-end traffic analytics capability.  It should be noted that\n\u00a0\nthe depiction in the pyramid does not explicitly address the relationships with\n\u00a0\nexternal organizations (e.g., county, state, private sector); however, supply chain risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement is certainly a critical part of the RMF.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity and Privacy: Differences and Overlap\n\u00a0\nThe risk management process can apply to both cybersecurity and privacy.\n\u00a0\nIndeed, many privacy risks and the management of those risks can be viewed as\n\u00a0\nidentical to or synonymous with cybersecurity risks.  However, there are instances\n\u00a0\nwhen privacy may deviate from the traditional notion of cybersecurity.\n\u00a0\nNonetheless, cybersecurity and privacy are undoubtedly interrelated and\n\u00a0\ncomplementary and coordination between those two areas of risk is necessary.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity traditionally focuses on the \u200b\nconfidentiality\u200b\n, \u200b\nintegrity\u200b\n, and \u200b\navailability\n\u00a0\nof data and data systems.  Privacy generally pertains to specific types of data - such\n\u00a0\nas personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI)\n -\n\u00a0\n10\nand goes beyond the three core attributes of cybersecurity.  Privacy necessarily\n\u00a0\nrequires cybersecurity (in particular confidentiality), but privacy also involves the\n\u00a0\nprotection of data over its entire lifecycle, including determining how it is \u200b\ncreated\u200b\n;\n\u00a0\nhow it is \u200b\ncollected\u200b\n; how and where it is \u200b\nprocessed and stored\u200b\n; how it is \u200b\nused\u200b\n and \u200b\nby\n\u00a0\nwhom\u200b\n; how it is \u200b\ndisseminated or disclosed\u200b\n; and how it is \u200b\ndisposed\u200b\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile there are often shared goals between cybersecurity and privacy, it is worth\n\u00a0\nnoting that cybersecurity and privacy could potentially conflict at times.  For\n\u00a0\nexample, a cybersecurity capability may require the decryption of data, thereby\n\u00a0\ncreating the potential for exposure or misuse.  At a broader level, cybersecurity is\n\u00a0\noften associated with mass collection of data and surveillance, which can raise\n\u00a0\nmany privacy questions.  There are certainly mitigations and controls to address\n\u00a0\nsuch conflicts (e.g., technical and administrative controls, such as data\n\u00a0\nde-identification and data minimization) but ultimately, coordination between the\n\u00a0\ntwo disciplines is necessary to ensure desired cybersecurity, privacy, and shared\n\u00a0\noutcomes are achieved.\n\u00a0\n10\n \n\u200b\nIt is important to note that there are varying definitions of privacy.  While some definitions of privacy\n\u00a0\nmay be more focused on the individual citizen and associated personal data (e.g., PII, PHI), privacy\n\u00a0\nprinciples can also pertain to intellectual property or other corporate or government data, for example.\n\u00a0\n20 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity and privacy provide a means for building and establishing trust in\n\u00a0\nSmart City environments.  The burden, however, is on the municipality or relevant\n\u00a0\nSmart City capability providers to offer adequate levels of cybersecurity and\n\u00a0\nprivacy.  The expectation cannot be on the individual or citizen to manage and\n\u00a0\ncontrol the cybersecurity and privacy of their own data within the Smart City\n\u00a0\nenvironment.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis document is intended to present cybersecurity and privacy risk management\n\u00a0\nas a combined process.

It is\n\u00a0\nmeant to be complementary to existing risk management and information\n\u00a0\nsecurity programs, and help strengthen them.  The processes and taxonomies (e.g.,\n\u00a0\nfunctions, categories, subcategories) presented by CSF can generate inputs for the\n\u00a0\nRMF (e.g., establishing and standardizing cybersecurity requirements, establishing\n\u00a0\ntailored control baselines, or developing baseline and target profiles) and also\n\u00a0\nfacilitate the communication and reporting of cybersecurity and privacy risk\n\u00a0\ninformation across the organization.  The bulk of the direct alignment between the\n\u00a0\nCSF and the RMF is in the RMF \u201cPrepare\u201d step, which is further discussed later in\n\u00a0\nthis document.  The alignment between CSF and the other RMF steps varies\n\u00a0\nconsiderably and can be dependent on the framework user\u2019s interpretation.  The\n\u00a0\nlatest version of the RMF (SP 800-37 Rev. 2) was explicitly updated to provide\n\u00a0\nreferences that indicate the alignment between the CSF and specific RMF steps\n\u00a0\nand tasks.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework Core\n\u00a0\n11\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNIST Risk Management Framework\n\u00a0\nThe latest version of the NIST RMF (Revision 2) describes a seven-step risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement process where the original six steps are preceded by a foundational\n\u00a0\npreparation phase (i.e., Prepare).  This process as a whole, as well as each step in the\n\u00a0\nprocess, is iterative in nature and is continuously applied to information systems and\n\u00a0\ninformation flows across the organization.

This determination takes into account the outputs from the previous\n\u00a0\nsteps of the RMF process, including system security and privacy plans; the\n\u00a0\nsystem-specific, common, and hybrid controls specified therein; and the findings\n\u00a0\nfrom the assessment step (i.e., step 4).  The authorization decision is typically made\n\u00a0\nby a senior management official internal to the organization.  This authorizing\n\u00a0\nofficial, in collaboration with other security, privacy, and risk personnel, takes the\n\u00a0\navailable information (e.g., system security and privacy plans, assessment reports,\n\u00a0\norganizational risk management strategy) to analyze and determine the amount of\n\u00a0\nrisk associated with operating a given system.  This step ultimately determines\n\u00a0\nwhether systems are authorized to operate or not authorized to operate, along with\n\u00a0\nthe associated terms and conditions (e.g., authorization duration).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKey \u201cAuthorize\u201d Tasks and Steps\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nGenerate authorization package, including outputs from previous steps such\n\u00a0\nas system security and privacy plans, supply chain risk management plans,\n\u00a0\nsecurity and privacy assessment reports, and POA&Ms\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nConduct risk analysis and risk determination (by authorizing official)\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nProvide risk response (e.g., risk acceptance, risk mitigation)\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nApprove or deny system authorization\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nReport authorization to the organization for purposes of aggregated\n\u00a0\norganization-wide security and privacy risk awareness\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 6: Monitor\n\u00a0\nContinuous monitoring enables organizations to conduct the risk management\n\u00a0\nprocess in a continuous, near real-time manner rather than as a rigid process with a\n\u00a0\npre-determined schedule.  Changes in system configurations, hardware, software,\n\u00a0\ninterdependent systems and connections, threat environment, etc. are inevitable\n\u00a0\nover the life of the system.  As such changes occur, organizations need to be able to\n\u00a0\ncontinuously evaluate system-specific and organizational risk posture and to adjust\n\u00a0\naccordingly (e.g., re-categorize systems, select and implement additional controls,\n\u00a0\nremove obsolete controls).

Key Smart City Risk Management Considerations\n\u00a0\nOperationalizing and standardizing risk management across the organization is\n\u00a0\ncritical for minimizing cybersecurity and privacy risks during the development and\n\u00a0\noperation of Smart City capabilities and solutions.  It will be up to cities and their\n\u00a0\npartners to determine the appropriate risk management policies and processes to\n\u00a0\nadopt and implement based on their current risk management practices, risk\n\u00a0\nposture, and their risk management strategy.  While aspects of risk management\n\u00a0\nmay seem daunting and challenging, there are certainly opportunities that cities can\n\u00a0\nleverage to their advantage.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe following considerations are things that Smart City organizations should keep in\n\u00a0\nmind as they pursue the development, adaptation and maturation of their risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement programs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStrategic Considerations\n\u00a0\n \n\u25cf\nRisk management as a Smart City enabler - \u200b\nProper risk management\n\u00a0\npractices and communication of those risk management practices can\n\u00a0\nactually help enable the development, deployment, and operation of Smart\n\u00a0\nCity capabilities.  Risk management should not be viewed as an\n\u00a0\nencumbrance.  Proper cybersecurity and privacy controls can help gain public\n\u00a0\ntrust and buy-in and promote requisite participation in Smart City functions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nAdapt perspective to look beyond traditional IT enterprise - \u200b\nIoT projects\n\u00a0\nintroduce devices with connectivity and computational power at the network\n\u00a0\nedge.  Previously, devices with these capabilities were generally contained\n\u00a0\nwithin data centers or other network segments that could be configured for\n\u00a0\nlimited ingress/egress and monitored.  Existing threat models and risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement strategies and practices may need to be adapted and extended\n\u00a0\nto cover these new system components.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nIdentifying, understanding, and assessing interdependencies - \u200b\nSmart city\n\u00a0\nfunctionality may introduce new dependencies (e.g., data dependencies), and\n\u00a0\nrisk management decisions will need to consider the nature of these\n\u00a0\ninterdependencies.  While an information system or an information type may\n\u00a0\nbe low impact for some stakeholders, the system or data may be high impact\n\u00a0\nin another stakeholder\u2019s context.  Organizations need to consider these\n\u00a0\ndifferences in classification for such systems and data and ensure that they\n\u00a0\nare protected at the appropriate level.  Additionally, it is worth noting that\n\u00a0\ninterdependencies between traditionally \u201ccyber\u201d and traditionally \u201cphysical\u201d\n\u00a0\nsystems is fundamental to Smart Cities.  Identifying these interdependencies\n\u00a0\n32 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nand understanding and assessing how cybersecurity and privacy risks can\n\u00a0\npotentially translate into, for example, safety-related risks is critical.\n\u00a0\n26\n\u00a0\nCoordination and Communication Considerations\n\u00a0\n \n\u25cf\nIntra-governmental coordination and collaboration - \u200b\nGiven the\n\u00a0\ninterconnectedness and multi-stakeholder nature of Smart City capabilities\n\u00a0\nand solutions, successful risk management will require significant\n\u00a0\ncommunication, collaboration, and coordination between city departments\n\u00a0\nand agencies.  This necessitates the development of consensus, modification\n\u00a0\nof existing structures and processes, and consideration of new shared\n\u00a0\nresource and service models.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nPublic-private and intergovernmental coordination - \u200b\nSmart city systems\n\u00a0\noften involve a mix of assets that are inherently multi-party and\n\u00a0\nmulti-jurisdictional (e.g., city-owned and operated; regional;\n\u00a0\ncommercially-owned and operated).  Implementations involve numerous\n\u00a0\ngovernment, private sector, and quasi-governmental organizations and their\n\u00a0\nassociated products, services, capabilities, oversight, etc.  Successful risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement will require sharing of information (including potentially\n\u00a0\nbusiness-sensitive information), coordination of risk management and\n\u00a0\ngovernance practices, and alignment of organizational and system\n\u00a0\nboundaries.  Increasingly complex interconnectivity and interdependency will\n\u00a0\nnecessitate particular attention to IT and data stewardship.  Understanding\n\u00a0\nand clearly delineating system, data, risk, and liability ownership - and\n\u00a0\nultimately, accountability - will be essential to managing cybersecurity and\n\u00a0\nprivacy risk in an effective manner. As Smart City projects have the\n\u00a0\nunprecedented potential to impact residents either positively or negatively,\n\u00a0\nspecial care needs to be given to engage the residents throughout the project\n\u00a0\nlifecycle.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nExternal communication of risk management strategy and policies - \u200b\nIt is\n\u00a0\nimportant for organizations to adequately communicate risk management\n\u00a0\nstrategies, policies, and guidance not only to internal departments and\n\u00a0\nagencies but also to existing and prospective external partners, service\n\u00a0\nproviders, vendors, and constituents.  This enables external parties to\n\u00a0\nunderstand the risk management environment in which they are expected to\n\u00a0\nparticipate and also enables providers to develop capabilities based on\n\u00a0\nwell-established risk management practices (e.g., security and privacy control\n\u00a0\n26\n \n\u200b\nNIST SP 1190GB-5: Guide Brief 5 - Assessing Energy System Dependencies,\u200b\n provides an\n\u00a0\nexample of how system and organizational interdependencies can be identified and\n\u00a0\nevaluated.

Additionally, capability providers will be better enabled to\n\u00a0\ncollaborate with other capability providers and ensure that potential\n\u00a0\nintegrations of their offerings are compatible and do not create\n\u00a0\nunmanageable risks.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nResource Planning Considerations\n\u00a0\n \n\u25cf\nEvaluate costs and benefits of cybersecurity and privacy upfront -\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity and privacy risk mitigations must be considered as part of the\n\u00a0\noverall budget of any IoT project.  Some costs may be upfront (e.g., system\n\u00a0\ndesign reviews, pre-deployment comprehensive penetration testing) and\n\u00a0\nothers might be ongoing (e.g., active network traffic monitoring, insurance).\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, the potential technical, contractual, and legal costs associated\n\u00a0\nwith remediation and recovery from a breach or attack also need to be\n\u00a0\nconsidered and factored into the risk calculus.  Investing in cybersecurity and\n\u00a0\nprivacy risk management capabilities upfront can have the benefit of\n\u00a0\nmitigating or minimizing these potential costs (i.e., paying down risk).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nAccount for and provide resources for capability sustainment and\n\u00a0\nmaturation - \u200b\nRisk management and the implementation of cybersecurity\n\u00a0\nand privacy controls is not a one-time, compliance-based effort.  It is a\n\u00a0\nrepetitive process that will compel updates as technology advances, risk\n\u00a0\nprofiles adjust, and the organization\u2019s risk management program matures.\n\u00a0\nOrganizations will need to ensure that risk management capabilities and\n\u00a0\nprocesses can be sustained and allowed to improve and mature as required.\n \n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nLeverage existing IT/system assessment and auditing functions - \u200b\nIf a city\n\u00a0\nalready has an independent assessor or auditor (whether a government\n\u00a0\norganization or a contractor) for their enterprise IT systems, the scope of work\n\u00a0\ncould be expanded to include Smart City systems.  However, the city will need\n\u00a0\nto consider whether the assessor or auditor has the requisite, specialized\n\u00a0\nexpertise to evaluate the diverse set of Smart City technologies and systems.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProcurement, Contractual, and Supply Chain Considerations\n\u00a0\n27\n \n\u25cf\nConsider both insourcing and outsourcing for risk management functions\n\u00a0\n- \u200b\nThe decision to insource or outsource certain capabilities, services, or\n\u00a0\nfunctions is particularly important from the cybersecurity and privacy risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement perspective.  These decisions should also consider initial\n\u00a0\nimplementation and ongoing operation and maintenance of capabilities.\n\u00a0\nSome municipalities, particularly those who may be smaller or less mature,\n\u00a0\n27\n An in-depth discussion of supply chain risk management practices, considerations, and controls can\n\u00a0\nbe found in \u200b\nNIST SP 800-161: Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information\n\u00a0\nSystems and Organizations\u200b\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n34 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nmay not have the capacity to build out suitable in-house staffs and associated\n\u00a0\ninfrastructure.  With proper guidance and procurement processes, vendors\n\u00a0\nshould be able to build in or provide certain cybersecurity or privacy functions,\n\u00a0\nthereby decreasing the burden on in-house resources.  However, a risk\n\u00a0\ndecision of whether to trust vendor attestations or to evaluate and validate\n\u00a0\noutsourced cybersecurity and privacy functions in-house or through a\n\u00a0\nthird-party will come into play.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nLeverage acquisition and procurement mechanisms - \u200b\nRisk management\n\u00a0\nneeds to include acquisition and procurement offices and personnel \u2013 both in\n\u00a0\nthe establishment and implementation of risk management strategies and\n\u00a0\npractices.  Smart city solutions\u2019 dependence on external services and COTS\n\u00a0\nproducts provides an opportunity for Smart City buyers to dictate risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement requirements in contractual agreements, service level\n\u00a0\nagreements, product certifications, etc.  This is a means for Smart Cities to\n\u00a0\nhave some level of control over the security and privacy of systems and\n\u00a0\nproducts that would otherwise be out of their control and ultimately assist in\n\u00a0\nmitigating enterprise risk.  However, procurement strategies and practices\n\u00a0\nneed to be flexible and be able to adapt to changing threat environments and\n\u00a0\ncorresponding cybersecurity and privacy requirements.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nUnderstand supply chain to truly determine risk profile - \u200b\nSmart cities are\n\u00a0\ninherently dependent on industry partners to support new development and\n\u00a0\ncapabilities in a variety of dynamic areas - e.g., distributed energy\n\u00a0\nproduction/management, telecommunications, traffic and facilities\n\u00a0\nmanagement, supporting infrastructure and services and cloud providers.\n\u00a0\nSimply evaluating the cyber hygiene of the Smart City is not enough.  To fully\n\u00a0\nunderstand what exposure to harm (legal or cost related) exists, Smart Cities\n\u00a0\nmust carefully evaluate how business partners support or directly interact\n\u00a0\nwith Smart City resources.  Independent studies show an alarming increase in\n\u00a0\nsuccessful compromises as a result of third parties.  Municipalities should\n\u00a0\nsolicit assistance from regulatory, legal, and cyber subject matter experts as to\n\u00a0\nhow to ensure a lower risk profile by requiring enhanced security posture of\n\u00a0\nthe Smart City\u2019s supply chain. The interdependency between municipality and\n\u00a0\nthe private sector is extensive and the ability to effectively underwrite\n\u00a0\ninsurance for next generation Smart Cities will be dependent on evolving\n\u00a0\nlegally binding agreements (e.g., service level agreements, terms and\n\u00a0\nconditions, solicited/unsolicited proposals) to clearly define how to transfer or\n\u00a0\nmitigate risk exposure associated with the supply chain.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nManagement of risk from external services, systems, and products - \u200b\nSmart\n\u00a0\ncities\u2019 reliance on external services, contractor-owned systems, and COTS\n\u00a0\nproducts necessitates mechanisms to ensure the risks associated with\n\u00a0\n35 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nexternal services, systems, and products are properly managed.  This includes\n\u00a0\nall aspects of the risk management process, including the prioritization of\n\u00a0\nsystems and assets; the selection and implementation of controls; and the\n\u00a0\nindependent assessment and continuous monitoring of systems.  This may\n\u00a0\nrequire contractual agreements, service level agreements, or participation in\n\u00a0\nindependent, third-party certification programs; these mechanisms must also\n\u00a0\nbe able to adapt to the evolving technology environment, threat landscape,\n\u00a0\nand cybersecurity and privacy requirements.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nRequire vulnerability notification from commercial product suppliers -\n\u00a0\nSmart city deployments will undoubtedly involve COTS products and IoT\n\u00a0\ndevices of varying degrees of maturity - including cybersecurity and privacy\n\u00a0\ncapability maturity.  As products mature and the threat landscape changes, it\n\u00a0\nis essential for system and data owners to be notified of and aware of newly\n\u00a0\ndiscovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner.  Actions that follow notification\n\u00a0\nof vulnerabilities will be dependent on the assessment of risk associated with\n\u00a0\nthat particular vulnerability, the available mitigations (e.g., patches), and the\n\u00a0\ncosts, including labor, financial, potential system downtime, downstream\n\u00a0\neffects on interdependent systems, etc.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTechnical and IoT-Specific Considerations\n\u00a0\n \n\u25cf\nTechnological diversity and limitations - \u200b\nGiven the diverse array of\n\u00a0\ntechnologies in the Smart City environment (e.g., IoT devices), selected\n\u00a0\ncontrols \u2013 including common controls \u2013 may not be able to be implemented\n\u00a0\nas intended.

This frequency may vary by system security category and impact\n\u00a0\nlevel, mission, information type(s), and other organization risk factors.  That\n\u00a0\nsaid, the long-term risk management objective is to continue to move\n\u00a0\ntowards increased automation and truly continuous (i.e., real-time)\n\u00a0\nmonitoring of risk.\n\u00a0\n29\n\u00a0\nLegal and Liability Considerations\n\u00a0\n \n\u25cf\nUnderstand new and/or additional regulatory exposure - \u200b\nDepending on\n\u00a0\nthe organization(s) and on the types of data being processed by the IoT\n\u00a0\nsystem, various regulatory requirements may come into effect.  For instance, if\n\u00a0\na system includes healthcare data (e.g., vital sign information from wearable\n\u00a0\nsensors worn by first responders), HIPAA may apply.  Alternatively, if a system\n\u00a0\nincludes data that allows members of the public to be identified (e.g., video\n\u00a0\nrecordings), various privacy regimes may apply, such as GDPR or California\n\u00a0\ndata privacy laws.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nRisk mitigation through cybersecurity insurance - \u200b\nSmart cities can consider\n\u00a0\ncybersecurity insurance as a risk mitigation measure (i.e., risk transfer).\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity insurance is an expanding and open area of business\n\u00a0\nsupport/development, and can reduce potential financial loss (i.e.,\n\u00a0\nconsequence) and thereby reduce total risk.  However, insurance would only\n\u00a0\nbe suitable for mitigating certain risks (i.e., those that can directly translate\n\u00a0\ninto monetary loss).  A recent Wall Street Journal survey suggested that a\n\u00a0\n29\n \n\u200b\nIndeed, NIST 800-37 Rev. 2 recommends that \u201cOrganizations should maximize the use of automation,\n\u00a0\nwherever possible, to increase the speed, effectiveness, and efficiency of executing the steps in the Risk\n\u00a0\nManagement Framework (RMF). Automation is particularly useful in the assessment and continuous\n\u00a0\nmonitoring of controls, the preparation of authorization packages for timely decision-making, and the\n\u00a0\nimplementation of ongoing authorization approaches\u2014together facilitating a real-time or near\n\u00a0\nreal-time risk-based decision-making process for senior leaders. Organizations have significant\n\u00a0\nflexibility in deciding when, where, and how to use automation or automated support tools for their\n\u00a0\nsecurity and privacy programs. In some situations, automated assessments and monitoring of controls\n\u00a0\nmay not be possible or feasible.\u201d\n\u00a0\n37 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nmajority of the 25 largest U.S. cities have cyber insurance or are considering\n\u00a0\npurchasing it.\n\u00a0\n30\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nCautious use of non-disclosure agreements - \u200b\nThe use of non-disclosure\n\u00a0\nagreements (NDA) should be carefully considered.

Conclusion\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSmart cities and communities are not sustainable or truly smart if they do not\n\u00a0\nproactively and adaptively identify, deploy, and sustain cybersecurity and privacy risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement processes and measures.  This Guidebook intends to assist all cities\n\u00a0\nand communities with a Smart City cybersecurity and privacy risk management\n\u00a0\nvision to familiarize with basic practices, major challenges, and key Smart\n\u00a0\nCity-specific considerations ultimately to avoid common and costly mistakes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe wish to point out three caveats for reader awareness.  One is that this Guidebook\n\u00a0\nis intended for general purposes.  More granular guidance for specific functions such\n\u00a0\nas public safety or smart buildings can be found in GCTC SuperClusters\u2019 blueprints.\n\u00a0\nThose blueprints and this Guidebook are aligned in cybersecurity and privacy as\n\u00a0\nensured by the CPAC and the SuperClusters\u2019 leadership teams.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe second caveat is that although this Guidebook lays a solid foundation for specific\n\u00a0\ntools that can be used in support of cybersecurity and privacy risk management,\n\u00a0\nsuch tools are not introduced at this time.  CPAC aims at identifying such tools in the\n\u00a0\nnear future.  One example is a cyber risk needs assessment tool that starts with\n\u00a0\nmunicipalities\u2019 digital properties and characteristics and recommends best practices\n\u00a0\npertinent to their situation and target risk posture.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe third caveat is that technologies continue to rapidly evolve, as well as solutions,\n\u00a0\nbest practices, and considerations.  This Guidebook is a living document and will be\n\u00a0\nupdated as warranted.  Please be sure to reference the latest version.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe encourage readers to refer to the Appendices to see example use cases of how\n\u00a0\nrisk management processes can be leveraged and integrated in specific Smart City\n\u00a0\nimplementations.  These use cases can exemplify cybersecurity and privacy risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement concepts in real-world scenarios.  The Appendices also provide a list of\n\u00a0\nreferences used in the development of this document and can provide readers with\n\u00a0\nmore in-depth and detailed information regarding specific aspects of cybersecurity\n\u00a0\nand privacy risk management.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n39 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAppendix A.

For example, the \u201cIn-the-Know\u201d opportunity\n\u00a0\ncorresponds to a set of controls related to monitoring and detection, whereas\n\u00a0\n\u201cAt-the-Ready\u201d refers to incident response- and recovery-related capabilities.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n46 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nSuccess Metrics\n\u00a0\nADA and the municipality intend to regularly (e.g., quarterly, annually) monitor and\n\u00a0\nmeasure progress in managing cybersecurity and privacy risk through three metrics:\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nOverall risk posture as indicated by updated NCSR risk assessment scores\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nCybersecurity awareness survey results across key stakeholder groups\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nRating of confidence in municipality\u2019s cybersecurity posture across key\n\u00a0\nstakeholder groups\n\u00a0\nThese metrics, along with the updated risk assessments, can provide indications\n\u00a0\nabout where risk management activities are successful, deficient, or need to be\n\u00a0\nadjusted.  This repeatable process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks\n\u00a0\nfollowed by selecting, implementing, and assessing appropriate controls enables the\n\u00a0\nmunicipality to manage their risk posture and adapt to an ever-evolving operating\n\u00a0\nenvironment and threat landscape.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUse Case #3: Risk Assessment in the County of San Mateo, California\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis use case describes how risk assessment has been implemented in the County of\n\u00a0\nSan Mateo, California, and identifies activities that align most closely with the Step 0:\n\u00a0\nPrepare and Step 6: Monitor steps of the risk management process.  However, the\n\u00a0\nassessment process and the outputs from the assessment also involve elements\n\u00a0\nfrom and inform all of the other risk management steps (i.e., Step 1: Categorize, Step\n\u00a0\n2: Select, Step 3: Implement, Step 4: Assess, Step 5: Authorize).  Refer to Appendix B\n\u00a0\nof this Guidebook for an example of the risk assessment questionnaire and its\n\u00a0\napplication.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe County of San Mateo uses a Risk Assessment Questionnaire to ensure that\n\u00a0\ntechnology projects are aligned with the County\u2019s Information Security Policy.

This use case posits\n\u00a0\nsome of the major activities, key stakeholders, and potential resources for each step\n\u00a0\nof the cybersecurity and privacy risk management process.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA key element of Smart Cities is smart public safety.  Smart public safety starts with\n\u00a0\ntraditional public safety agencies - namely fire, law enforcement, emergency\n\u00a0\nmedical services, and 911 call centers - that would like to add IoT devices as another\n\u00a0\nmeans of communication between first responders and between the first\n\u00a0\nresponders and the 911 dispatch centers.  Public safety agencies are already starting\n\u00a0\nto use body-worn devices (e.g., cameras and biometric sensors).  During the incident\n\u00a0\noperations, IoT data from sensors and other real-time devices can increase\n\u00a0\nsituational awareness and aid in incident command and control.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 0: Prepare\n\u00a0\nIn smart public safety, public safety agencies themselves could be responsible for\n\u00a0\ncybersecurity and privacy; alternatively, they could be partnering with IT or\n\u00a0\ninformation security organizations (e.g., Department of Information Technology).  In\n\u00a0\nmost states in the U.S., the state legislature authorizes and appropriates funds based\n\u00a0\non an authorized scope.  The IT organization will often have a cybersecurity and\n\u00a0\nprivacy strategy that includes using one or more of the risk management\n\u00a0\nframeworks, or elements thereof.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor this use case we are assuming that we are using the NIST RMF, which has been\n\u00a0\ndetailed in this Guidebook.  There are also existing statewide security policies; but\n\u00a0\nthey do not allow connected IoT devices until risk management security capabilities\n\u00a0\nhave been defined, and devices provide the necessary capabilities to support the\n\u00a0\nrequisite cybersecurity and privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is the intention of this support for implementation of IoT cybersecurity and privacy\n\u00a0\nto be funded by further State legislature appropriating funds for extending the risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement program for Smart Cities and smart public safety which includes\n\u00a0\nusage of body worn devices and supporting vendor upgrades.\n\u00a0\n48 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 1: Categorize\n\u00a0\nThe information types collected, processed, and transmitted by the wearable IoT\n\u00a0\ndevices are real-time video and sensor data.  The systems and system components\n\u00a0\nare categorized as critical information data, and that mandates that the systems and\n\u00a0\nnetworks be of a public safety grade mission critical mode of operation.  Public\n\u00a0\nSafety Grade cybersecurity and privacy policies and standards have been described\n\u00a0\nfor normal mobile devices, but corresponding policies and standards for IoT-based\n\u00a0\ndevices still need to be defined.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 2: Select\n\u00a0\nNIST RMF-based cybersecurity and privacy controls have been selected for IT\n\u00a0\nsystems security controls.  Additional cybersecurity and privacy controls for IoT\n\u00a0\nwould follow the NISTIR 8196\n and NISTIR 8228\n and the new, example (12) security\n\u00a0\n38\n39\ncontrols and (4) privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo additional controls beyond those proposed in NISTIR 8196 and NISTIR 8228 have\n\u00a0\nbeen identified.  No tailoring of controls has been done as the IT Department wants\n\u00a0\nto identify and implement a standardized and consistent (i.e., baseline) set of\n\u00a0\nsecurity control. This may change as the implementation of IoT devices is better\n\u00a0\ndefined.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 3: Implement\n\u00a0\nCybersecurity and privacy requirements from NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, NIST SP 800-39,\n\u00a0\nNIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, NISTIR 8196, NISTIR 8228, and other documents were used to\n\u00a0\ngenerate specific device security capabilities requirements that support and enable\n\u00a0\nthe selected cybersecurity and privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe chosen vendor solution supports a shared operational model for the operational\n\u00a0\nSecurity Operation Center (SOC) using security information and event management\n\u00a0\n(SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) capabilities.\n\u00a0\nMany of the RMF functions supported by IT Department are used in support of these\n\u00a0\nnew IoT devices, networks, and applications.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is anticipated that the security operations center (SOC) will implement the tools\n\u00a0\nand capabilities necessary to ensure that the IoT device security capabilities are\n\u00a0\nleveraged to implement the selected security controls from NIST SP 800-53 and\n\u00a0\nNISTIR 8228.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n38\n Draft NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8196, \u200b\nSecurity Analysis of First Responder Mobile and\n\u00a0\nWearable Devices\u200b\n, December 2018.\n\u00a0\n39\n Draft NISTIR 8228, \u200b\nConsiderations for Managing Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity and Privacy\n\u00a0\nRisks\u200b\n, September 2018.\n\u00a0\n49 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nStep 4: Assess\n\u00a0\nThe Security Operations Center mitigation and monitoring personnel have the\n\u00a0\nresponsibility for proper implementation and operation of the selected cybersecurity\n\u00a0\nand privacy controls.  The SOC is staffed by IT/IoT cybersecurity analysts and then\n\u00a0\nvendor specialists.

Given the\n\u00a0\noverlapping relationship of cybersecurity and privacy, much of the information in\n\u00a0\nthis use case may sound similar to, or even identical to, aspects of cybersecurity risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement.  This reinforces the notion that cybersecurity and privacy are closely\n\u00a0\nrelated and should generally be considered in tandem.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne fundamental tenet of Smart Cities is the creation, collection, use, and other\n\u00a0\nmethods of processing often vast amounts of data to improve city services and\n\u00a0\noperations.  This has the potential to introduce significant data privacy risks.\n\u00a0\nWhether we are discussing individual privacy, corporate privacy, or municipal\n\u00a0\nprivacy, compromised data can result in tangible and irreparable damage.  For\n\u00a0\nexample, individuals can lose their reputation, job, family, health coverage, bank\n\u00a0\naccounts, or control of their identity; a company can lose its intellectual property,\n\u00a0\nreputation, customer base, etc.; and a municipality can lose control of its\n\u00a0\ninfrastructure and supported services, whereby thousands or millions of people can\n\u00a0\nbe affected.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe RMF provides a process for establishing a Privacy Program to help organizations\n\u00a0\nprotect data over its entire lifecycle.  The activities described below are not intended\n\u00a0\nto be comprehensive, but rather identify some key privacy and data protection\n\u00a0\nconsiderations.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nStep 0: Prepare\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nIdentify employees and external resources - including privacy experts - to\n\u00a0\nparticipate in a cross-departmental and -functional team\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nProvide privacy training so that everyone knows what to look for and what to\n\u00a0\nconsider.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nEstablish a regular process and meeting to identify all department\u2019s data\n\u00a0\nassets.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nDocument what data types are processed; current data use procedures; how\n\u00a0\nelectronic information is handled; past problems or gaps in process; goals that\n\u00a0\nmay impact data types/use; employee training and experience; what systems\n\u00a0\nare used to process data; and what condition those systems are in, to name a\n\u00a0\nfew.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nCreate a table for Data Classification of the Elements.  As risks associated with\n\u00a0\na data element are identified, that data element is assigned a Classification.\n\u00a0\nThe Classification informs the organization of the cybersecurity and privacy\n\u00a0\nmeasures that need to be implemented and how data handling will be\n\u00a0\nrestricted.\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nIdentify and prioritize known privacy risks.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nConduct privacy risk assessment including identifying and determining the\n\u00a0\nefficacy of existing privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nConsider strategies for implementing improvements and reducing privacy\n\u00a0\nrisk.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nIdentify regulatory compliance requirements.\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nEstablish a Privacy Policy and/or Strategy to govern the organization\u2019s privacy\n\u00a0\nrisk management activities and include a mechanism to routinely update the\n\u00a0\npolicy or strategy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 1: Categorize\n\u00a0\nThe types of data that are created, used, shared, viewed, stored or processed in some\n\u00a0\nother way, are classified by looking at the risk consequence if the confidentiality,\n\u00a0\nintegrity, or availability of the data is compromised at any point in its lifecycle.  A\n\u00a0\ngreater risk generally requires greater risk mitigation measures.  What electronic\n\u00a0\nsystems are needed?  What level of security and privacy needs to be in the system\n\u00a0\ndesign?  For example, if a system breach revealed non-sensitive floor plans we may\n\u00a0\nnot be concerned; if a breach revealed bank account numbers, passwords, and\n\u00a0\nbalances, we would be.  While privacy policies and regulations might determine data\n\u00a0\nclassification and commensurate security and privacy controls, security technology\n\u00a0\nenables data protection to the appropriate level.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 2: Select\n\u00a0\nWhat options are available to achieve the necessary controls for protecting against\n\u00a0\nor mitigating the various identified privacy risks?  Data of the same classification\n\u00a0\nlevels should be subject to similar sets of cybersecurity and privacy controls.

Some key\n\u00a0\nprivacy-centric security controls that are often considered include encryption,\n\u00a0\nde-identification, anonymization, media sanitization, and geographic storage\n\u00a0\nrestrictions.  Application of cybersecurity and privacy controls to data-at-rest versus\n\u00a0\ndata-in-motion versus data-in-use may also affect the selection of specific controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 3: Implement\n\u00a0\nIdentify the required tasks, step by step, to implement your plan and selected\n\u00a0\ncontrols.  Document and save all system designs, architecture with data flow charts,\n\u00a0\nand the data classification involved.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 4: Assess\n\u00a0\nAn important and prevalent tool for assessing privacy risk and the effectiveness of\n\u00a0\ncontrols is a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).  Assessments should be conducted\n\u00a0\nobjectively to determine whether implementation has been completed to\n\u00a0\nspecification and working as intended.  Any deficiencies are documented, and a\n\u00a0\ncorrective plan is put in place.  Once corrected, another assessment should take\n\u00a0\nplace to ensure compliance and that the desired outcome regarding the protection\n\u00a0\nof privacy is achieved.  Assessors should be independent and also experienced in the\n\u00a0\ndata type and security systems involved.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 5: Authorize\n\u00a0\nThis step ensures accountability for a system that is designed to meet the required\n\u00a0\nprivacy needs.  An informational package detailing all steps and outcomes is\n\u00a0\nprepared, and includes responsible roles and their team names, as well as the risk\n\u00a0\nassessments, privacy impact assessments, and strategy behind the decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 6: Monitor\n\u00a0\nThis step involves the ongoing evaluation of the privacy risk environment to identify\n\u00a0\nchanges as well as opportunities to achieve the desired risk posture.  Inputs can\n\u00a0\ninclude audits, incident debriefs, survey results, a changing threat landscape, and a\n\u00a0\nchanging regulatory environment.  This monitoring can feed the refinement of\n\u00a0\nprivacy policies and procedures necessary to keep pace with evolving privacy risks.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n52 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\nAppendix B.

      "snippet": "fying that need.  \n \nDealing with cloud services requires attention to the roles and responsibilities involved between \nthe organization and cloud provider, particularly with respect to managing risks and ensuring organizational requirements are met. Ensuring systems are secure  and risk is managed is \nchallenging in any environment and even more daunting with cloud computing. Audit mechanisms and tools should be in place to determine how data is stored, protected, and used, to validate services, and to verify policy enforcement. A risk management program should also be in place that is flexible enough to deal with the continuously evolving and shifting risk landscape.  \n \n \nCompliance  \n Compliance refers to an organization\u2019s responsibility to operate in agreement with established \nlaws, regulations, standards, and specifications. Various types of security and privacy laws and regulations exist within different countries at the national, state, and local levels, making compliance a potentially complicated issue for cloud computing.  \n Law and Regulations  \nCloud providers are becoming more sensitive to legal and regulatory concerns, and may be \nwilling to commit to store and process data in specific jurisdictions and apply required safeguards for security and privacy. However, the degree to which they will ac cept liability \nin their service agreements, for exposure of content under their control, remains to be seen. Even so, organizations are ultimately accountable for the security and privacy of data held by a cloud provider on their behalf.  \n \nData Location \nOne of the most common compliance issues facing an organization is data location. A characteristic of many cloud computing services is that data is stored redundantly in multiple physical locations and detailed information about the location of an organiza tion\u2019s \ndata is unavailable or not disclosed to the service consumer. This situation makes it difficult to ascertain whether sufficient safeguards are in place and whether legal and regulatory \n \n12/27/2024   \nCJISSECPOL v6.0  G.3-11 compliance requirements are being met. External audits and security certifications can \nalleviate this issue to some extent, but they are not a panacea.  \n \nWhen information crosses borders, the governing legal, privacy, and regulatory regimes \ncan be ambiguous and raise a variety of concerns. Consequently, constraints on the trans -\nborder flow of sensitive data, as well as the requirements on the protection aff orded the \ndata, have become the subject of national and regional privacy and security laws and regulations.  \n \nElectronic Discovery  \nThe capabilities and processes of a cloud provider, such as the form in which data is \nmaintained and the electronic discovery- related tools available, affect the ability of the \norganization to meet its obligations in a cost effective, timely, and compliant manner. A \ncloud provider\u2019s archival capabilities may not preserve the original metadata as expected, causing spoliation (i.e., the intentional, reckless, or negligent destruction, loss, material alteration, or obstruction of evidence that is relevant to l itigation), which could negatively \nimpact litigation.  \n \n \nTrust  \n Under the cloud computing paradigm, an organization relinquishes direct control over many \naspects of security and privacy, and in doing so, confers a high level of trust onto the cloud provider. At the same time, federal agencies have a responsibility to protect information and information systems commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction, regardless of whether the information is collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency; or whether the information systems are used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency  \n \nInsider Access  \nData processed or stored outside the physical confines of an organization, its firewall, and \nother security controls bring with it an inherent level of risk. The insider security threat is a well -known issue for most organizations. Incidents may involve va rious types of fraud, \nsabotage of information resources, and theft of sensitive information.  \n \nData Ownership  \nThe organization\u2019s ownership rights over the data must be firmly established in the service \ncontract to enable a basis for trust and privacy of data. The continuing controversy over \n \n12/27/2024   \nCJISSECPOL v6.0  G.3-12 privacy and data ownership rights for social networking users illustrates the impact that \nambiguous terms can have on the parties involved.  \n Ideally, the contract should state clearly that the organization retains exclusive ownership \nover all its data; that the cloud provider acquires no rights or licenses through the \nagreement, including intellectual property rights or licenses, to use the organization\u2019s data \nfor its own purposes; and that the cloud provider ",
