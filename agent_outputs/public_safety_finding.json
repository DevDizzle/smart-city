The \nprincipal goal of this program is to support the ability of any region, municipality,  community,  or \nneighborhood  in achieving its vision for public -focused innovation through the application of advanced \ntechnologies.    \nThis document and the strategy that it describes should be considered a \u201cliving document\u201d and will be \nupdated as the plan, the IoT and CPS2 technologies , and the smart cities movement  evolve.  \n  \n \n1 The term \u201csmart city\u201d as used throughout this document is a widely accepted term  to represent  any city, community, town, or region that \ndevelops, invests in, and integrates digital technologies with the goal of improving services and operations, enhancing cost -effectiv eness, and \nimproving resident\u2019s quality of life (See Section 1.3). Where the ter m Smart City is capitalized  in this document , it references the NIST Smart \nCity Infrastructure program or other NIST initiative s or documentation. Where the term appears in lower case, it refers to smart cities, generically  \n(e.g., the  \u201cbroader  smart city c ommunity \u201d). \n2 Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber -Physical Systems (CPS) are foundational technologies in smart cities and are described in this document.  \nNIST SP 1900 -207 \nJune 2024  \n3 \n 1. Introduction  and Origin  of the GCTC  \nThis publication provides a Strategic Plan for the  Smart City Infrastructure program (SCI) of the National \nInstitute for Standards and Technology (NIS T). The SCI program co nducts  research in smart cit ies and IoT -\nbased  technologies and coordinates  the Global Community Technology Challenge  (GCTC \u2014formerly the \nGlobal City Teams Challenge ) a smart cities program established  and maintained  by NIST . \n The GCTC  is an international  public -private partnership of cities and communities, local and state \ngovernment agencies, private -sector for -profit and non -profit entities , universities , and research institutes  \ndedicated to improving urban , suburban , and rural  environment s and residents\u2019 quality of life through the \nintegration of advanced cyber -physical systems and Internet  of Things (IoT) -based technologies. NIST  \nserves as the  federal  coordinator  for both the nation al and international dimensions  of th e partnership , in \ncollaboration with  other federal agencies and offices that sponsor smart city -related projects and research .   \nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST)  is the research laboratory  of the Department of \nCommerce with the missi on to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness  by advancing \nmeasurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our \nquality of life . Through the creation and sponsorship  of the GCTC, NIST  plays  a significant role i n \ncatalyzing  the transition of advanced  technologies  and standards  to state s and  local communities  in order \nfor them to improv e options for technology integration .  The resulting integrations can allow communities  \nto improv e city services, build resilient infrastructure,  advance  economic  equity and sustainability , and \nimprove  residents\u2019 overall quality of life . NIST\u2019s focus on creating critical measurement solutions and  \npromoting the development and adoption of consensus -based standards  provides  a unique  contribution as \na federal  agency  partner to the global  smart cities movement . Likewise,  NIST\u2019s  development of  \nframeworks, measures of effectiveness , and analytic tools  offers  city officials, community leaders, and \ncitizens  the ability to more  effectively  assess  investment options and to make informed decisions about  \nbenefits, costs , and achievements in advancing city goals and objectives  through the integration  of advanced \ntechnologies . As explained  in the NIST Stra tegic Plan 2020 -2025,  \nNIST engages in technology transfer working directly with companies and \n",

Moreover, the trend toward IoT sensors and cyber -\nphysical systems \u2014coupled with dramatic change s in hazards and threats to complex, urban societies \u2014\nargues for a n organization and framework for identifying innovative technologies, strategies, and \ncapabilities within a fully collaborative, multi -disciplinary environment.   \nTo that end, the goal of the  GCTC is to establish  an enduring , international  public -private partnership to \nbuild capacity in re search  and development  in technologies for public benefit through engagement with  a \ncoalition of community officials  and leaders , private sector developers, university researchers, community \nstakeholders, and government agencies  at all levels . This partnership will  examine  and facilitate the \nadoption of  innovative concepts that enhance  the delivery of public services in such areas as  public safety , \nhealth , and security ; economic vitality and equity ; community resilience  and sustainability ; and challe nges \nat the interface between urban and rural ecosystems . The initiative has f ive principal  objectives:  \n1) Support the smart cit y movement  by nurturing integrated, multi -disciplinary research in strategies \nand technologies  across technical , jurisdictional , and geographic  boundaries ;  \n2) Identify and address capability gaps and challenges  and assist in developing frameworks, analytic \nmethod s, and resources  to build a scientific  foundation for smart cities and communities ; \n3) Facilitate  collaborat ion with federal,  state, county, and municipal partners to define  and validate \ntechnolog y requirements , metrics , and standards  for enhancing community services and  operatio ns; \n4) Engage with international partners  and allies  to enhance cross -border interoperability, international \nstandards development, and  mutual objectives  for environmental sustainability  and resilience, \neconomic growth , and common values  for sharing the benefits of advanced technology integration .       \n5) Sponsor opportunities for enhancing  programs in Science, Technology, Engineering , Art, and Math \n(STE AM) and other interdisciplinary educational programs  to engag e the next generation  of \nscientists, engineers, technologists, community leaders, and citizens while contributing to local and \nregional workforce development goals.  \nAs in the previous years, t he immediate goal of the GCTC is to provide a forum for increas ing awareness \nof emerging technology applications and enhanc ing collaboration among GCTC member communities and \nsmart city partners . Future efforts will be dedicated to  enhancing rese arch and  information sharing  and to \nadvance state -of-the-art, technologies and concepts. The Vision and Mission Statements to guide the GCTC \nare as follows:  \nNIST SP 1900 -207 \nJune 2024  \n13 \n VISION:  Sustain a  federally sponsored  collaboration among  communities  \ndedicated to  improving city services  and enhancing quality of life  through the \nintegration of advanced  technologies.  \nMISSION: GCTC  will coordinate  a public -private partnership of communities  \ndedicated to  accelerat ing the integration of advanced technologies  to achieve \ndigital transformation  and enable  communities to become more sustainable, \nequitable, resilient, and livable.  \nAs the GCTC  sponsoring org anization , the NIST Smart Citie s Infrastructure program  will identify research \nopportunities and develop methods for assessing options , measuring outcomes , and developing standards  \nand key performance indicators to assist city officials, community leaders,  and citizens in assessing benefits, \ndefining costs, and  achieving  community goals  from  the adoption of advanced digital  technolog ies.  \n3. Principal Goals of the GCTC  2024-2026  \nA principal objective  of the NIST Smart City Infrastructure (SCI) effort is to build collaborative research \npartnerships between NIST laboratories and Operating Units with the advanced technology initiatives of \nU.S. cities, industry partners, and university research laboratori es. Through the Global Community \nTechnology C hallenge , the SCI research program leverages smart cities and communities in partnership \nwith NIST expertise in measurement science and standards development to build a network of community -\nfocused \u201cliving labor atories\u201d to define a science -based understanding of how cities function as complex \nadaptive systems having technological, environmental, economic, and social dimensions.

As previously discussed on page 158, there are several exceptions to this confidentiality \nprovision, including a court order issued upon a showing of good cause.  In State Attorney\u2019s \nOffice , the appellate court affirmed the trial judge\u2019s order mandating release of surveillance video \nfrom a school shooting where 17 students and staff were killed.  The court found that the media \nhad established good cause because the footage revealed the conduct of public servants in the \ndischarge of their duties and also provided \u201cinsight\u201d into the high school\u2019s security \u201cnet\u201d that \nfailed to protect the students and staff.

Miami Herald Media Company ,  278 So. 3d 786 (Fla. 1st \nDCA 2019).  At the hearing, the Miami Herald advised that it no longer needed the video \nrecordings as they were no longer newsworthy.  Nevertheless the court still found that the Herald \nhad satisfied the statutory exception to confidentiality, noting the awards the journalist received \nfor her reporting on prison issues, and that this fact, combined with the \u201cextremely important \nright of freedom of the press\u201d constituted good cause.  The appellate court reversed, finding that \nthe Herald \u201cextinguished any claim to good cause when it unambiguously renounced its need for \nthe video footage.\u201d  278 So. 3d at 790.\nc. Cybersecurity\nSection 119.01(2)(a), F .S., states that agencies \u201cmust provide reasonable public access to \nrecords electronically maintained and must ensure that exempt or confidential records are not \ndisclosed except as otherwise permitted by law.\u201d   Cf. AGO 19-08 (pension board authorized to \nrelease nonpublic personnel information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with a vendor \nconducting cybersecurity testing of the board\u2019s electronic data storage systems).\nAccordingly, an agency is not required to provide direct access to the agency\u2019s electronic \nrecords through a hard drive provided by a requester, but must otherwise allow inspection and \ncopying of such records in a manner which will accommodate the request, but protect exempt \nor confidential materials from disclosure.

This use case posits\n\u00a0\nsome of the major activities, key stakeholders, and potential resources for each step\n\u00a0\nof the cybersecurity and privacy risk management process.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA key element of Smart Cities is smart public safety.  Smart public safety starts with\n\u00a0\ntraditional public safety agencies - namely fire, law enforcement, emergency\n\u00a0\nmedical services, and 911 call centers - that would like to add IoT devices as another\n\u00a0\nmeans of communication between first responders and between the first\n\u00a0\nresponders and the 911 dispatch centers.  Public safety agencies are already starting\n\u00a0\nto use body-worn devices (e.g., cameras and biometric sensors).  During the incident\n\u00a0\noperations, IoT data from sensors and other real-time devices can increase\n\u00a0\nsituational awareness and aid in incident command and control.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 0: Prepare\n\u00a0\nIn smart public safety, public safety agencies themselves could be responsible for\n\u00a0\ncybersecurity and privacy; alternatively, they could be partnering with IT or\n\u00a0\ninformation security organizations (e.g., Department of Information Technology).  In\n\u00a0\nmost states in the U.S., the state legislature authorizes and appropriates funds based\n\u00a0\non an authorized scope.  The IT organization will often have a cybersecurity and\n\u00a0\nprivacy strategy that includes using one or more of the risk management\n\u00a0\nframeworks, or elements thereof.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor this use case we are assuming that we are using the NIST RMF, which has been\n\u00a0\ndetailed in this Guidebook.  There are also existing statewide security policies; but\n\u00a0\nthey do not allow connected IoT devices until risk management security capabilities\n\u00a0\nhave been defined, and devices provide the necessary capabilities to support the\n\u00a0\nrequisite cybersecurity and privacy controls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is the intention of this support for implementation of IoT cybersecurity and privacy\n\u00a0\nto be funded by further State legislature appropriating funds for extending the risk\n\u00a0\nmanagement program for Smart Cities and smart public safety which includes\n\u00a0\nusage of body worn devices and supporting vendor upgrades.\n\u00a0\n48 of 65\n\u00a0\n \n \nGlobal City Teams Challenge 2019: Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Challenge (SC3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGCTC-SC3 Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee Guidebook\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 1: Categorize\n\u00a0\nThe information types collected, processed, and transmitted by the wearable IoT\n\u00a0\ndevices are real-time video and sensor data.  The systems and system components\n\u00a0\nare categorized as critical information data, and that mandates that the systems and\n\u00a0\nnetworks be of a public safety grade mission critical mode of operation.  Public\n\u00a0\nSafety Grade cybersecurity and privacy policies and standards have been described\n\u00a0\nfor normal mobile devices, but corresponding policies and standards for IoT-based\n\u00a0\ndevices still need to be defined.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 2: Select\n\u00a0\nNIST RMF-based cybersecurity and privacy controls have been selected for IT\n\u00a0\nsystems security controls.
